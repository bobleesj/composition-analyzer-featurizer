CAF helps solid-state chemists and materials scientists in generating compositional training data for compounds. Both experimentalists and novices can use this tool with a basic understanding of Python. The codebase is designed for easy customization.

Features:

- Generate compositional descriptors for binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds from Excel or `.cif` files
- Filter and sort chemical formulas using four different methods
- Merge Excel files
- No coding required
